#  College FAQ Chatbot using AI (NLP)

This project is an AI-based FAQ Chatbot created using Google Colab as part of the CodeAlpha Artificial Intelligence Internship.  
The chatbot answers common college-related questions using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.



##  Project Description

The College FAQ Chatbot helps students get instant answers to frequently asked college-related questions such as admissions, hostels, placements, facilities, and more.

The chatbot uses TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity to match user queries with the most relevant stored questions and returns the appropriate answer.

A Gradio-based web interface is used for easy and interactive user interaction.



##  Features

- AI-based FAQ Chatbot
- Uses NLP for text similarity
- TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity
- Handles unknown questions with fallback response
- Interactive Gradio user interface
- Implemented and executed in Google Colab



##  Technologies Used

- Python
- Google Colab
- Gradio
- Scikit-learn
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)



##  How to Run the Project (Google Colab)

1. Open the `College_FAQ_Chatbot.ipynb` file in Google Colab
2. Run the first cell to install dependencies:

3. Run all remaining cells
4. Enter your question in the Gradio interface
5. Get instant chatbot responses



##  Working Methodology

1. FAQ questions are pre-defined
2. Text is converted into vectors using TF-IDF
3. User input is transformed into a vector
4. Cosine similarity is calculated
5. The most similar answer is returned
6. If similarity score is low, a default response is shown
