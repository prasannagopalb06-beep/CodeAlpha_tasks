#  Object Detection and Tracking using AI

This project is an AI-based Object Detection and Tracking system developed as part of the CodeAlpha Artificial Intelligence Internship.  
The system detects objects in real-time from video or webcam input and tracks them across frames using computer vision and deep learning techniques.



##  Project Description

The Object Detection and Tracking project uses a pre-trained deep learning model to identify objects in video frames.  
Bounding boxes and labels are drawn around detected objects, and object tracking assigns unique IDs to maintain identity across frames.

The project is implemented and executed using Google Colab.



##  Features

- Real-time object detection
- Supports video or webcam input
- Uses pre-trained deep learning models
- Draws bounding boxes and labels
- Tracks objects across frames with unique IDs
- Implemented using Google Colab



##  Technologies Used

- Python
- Google Colab
- OpenCV
- YOLO / Faster R-CNN (pre-trained model)
- NumPy
- Computer Vision
- Deep Learning




##  How to Run the Project 

1. Open the `Object_Detection_Tracking.ipynb` file in Google Colab
2. Install required dependencies

3. Download or upload the pre-trained detection model
4. Upload a video file or connect webcam (if supported)
5. Run all cells to see detection and tracking results



##  Working Methodology

1. Capture video frames using OpenCV
2. Apply pre-trained object detection model
3. Detect objects and generate bounding boxes
4. Assign tracking IDs to detected objects
5. Track objects across consecutive frames
6. Display real-time detection output
