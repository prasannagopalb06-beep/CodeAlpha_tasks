#  Music Generation with AI

This project is an AI-based Music Generation system developed using Deep Learning as part of the CodeAlpha Artificial Intelligence Internship.  
The model learns musical patterns from MIDI files and generates new music sequences automatically.



##  Project Description

The Music Generation with AI project uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with LSTM layers to learn musical structures from MIDI data.  
After training, the model generates new music sequences which are converted back into MIDI format.

The entire project is implemented and executed using Google Colab.



##  Features

- AI-based music generation
- Trains on MIDI music datasets
- Uses LSTM (Recurrent Neural Network)
- Generates new musical sequences
- Converts generated notes into MIDI files
- Implemented using Google Colab



##  Technologies Used

- Python
- Google Colab
- TensorFlow / Keras
- music21
- NumPy
- Deep Learning (LSTM)




##  How to Run the Project

1. Open the `Music_Generation_AI.ipynb` file in Google Colab
2. Install required dependencies:


3. Upload MIDI dataset to Colab
4. Run all notebook cells step by step
5. Generated MIDI files will be saved in the output folder



##  Working Methodology

1. Collect MIDI music files
2. Extract musical notes and chords using `music21`
3. Convert notes into numerical sequences
4. Train an LSTM-based deep learning model
5. Generate new note sequences
6. Convert generated sequences into MIDI files
